//
//  ---- wiring --------------------------------------------------------------
//    A0..A10 (8,7,6,5,4,3,2,1,23,22,19) = A1B..A11B
//    D0..D7  (9..17)                    = **D0B..D7B only — the LOW byte**
//    /CE (18) = /EEROM
//    /WE (21) = **/WL**   (the board-global low-byte write strobe)
//    /OE (20) = 2A LS08 (10 = 4B.Q, 9 = /RESET -> 8)
//
//  The socket is wired for a 2 K x 8 part but the fitted X2804A is 512 x 8
//  (A0..A8 only), so the device repeats four times inside 0x805000-0x805FFF —
//  which is exactly MAME's `.mirror(0x7f8c00)`.  Addressing here is 9 bits;
//  the caller drops A10B/A11B.
//
//  ---- the unlock latch (4B LS74) ----------------------------------------
//    D (12) = GND        CK (11) = /WL
//    /PRE (10) = /UNLOCK  /CLR (13) = /RESET      Q (9) -> 2A LS08 pin 10
//
//  A write to /UNLOCK (0x806800) presets Q = 1, which drives /OE HIGH and so
//  permits the 28xx write cycle (the family inhibits a write while /OE is low).
//  The next RISING edge of /WL — the end of ANY low-byte write on the board,
//  not just an EEPROM one — clocks D = 0 back in and re-locks the part.
//  Exactly one write is permitted per unlock, which is MAME's
//  `lock_after_write(true)`.
//
//  Two orderings that matter and are reproduced here:
//   * The unlock write is itself a WORD write (`move.w d0,$e800.w`, pc 0xEA0),
//     so /WL rises at the end of that very cycle.  On the board /UNLOCK (two
//     gate delays behind /AS) is still low when /WL (one gate delay) rises, so
//     the preset wins and the unlock survives its own write.  Modelled as
//     "unlock beats the coincident /WL".
//   * `write_accepted` samples `unlocked` BEFORE the same strobe re-locks the
//     part, so the byte the game is unlocking for does get stored.
//
//  ---- /OE and reads ------------------------------------------------------
//  /OE = Q & /RESET.  While the part is unlocked (Q = 1) /OE is HIGH and the
//  outputs are OFF: a read in that window returns the floating bus, not the
//  cell.  The game masks all interrupts around unlock+write (pc 0xE9C..0xEA6)
//  so it never reads there, but the behaviour is modelled rather than assumed
//  away.  While /RESET is low the outputs are ON and writes are blocked.
//
//  ---- programming time ---------------------------------------------------
//  The X2804A data sheet gives a self-timed byte write of typically 5 ms and at
//  most 10 ms, with the I/O pins high-Z throughout.  The default is the 10 ms
//  bound; `WRITE_CYCLES` is a parameter so a focused simulation need not run
//  half a million clocks.  The game reads a byte back and skips both the
//  unlock and the write when it already matches (pc 0xE96), so a busy read
//  returning 0xFF simply makes it try again later.
//
//  ---- the part erases itself at power-up ---------------------------------
//  A factory X2804A reads 0xFF; an inferred FPGA RAM powers up at 0x00, and an
//  all-zero part is NOT the "unprogrammed" state the game's boot code expects.
//  So this module establishes the erased state itself rather than relying on
//  the loader, the MRA or the synthesis tool's RAM initialisation.  The rule,
//  and why an all-zero part is worse than an erased one, are in the block
//  above `programmed` below.

	//
	// The `initial` above is SIMULATION ONLY.  On the FPGA this array is an
	// inferred RAM and every cell powers up at 0x00 unless something writes it,
	// and the only thing that normally does is the MRA's 0x200-byte erased tail
	// arriving on ioctl index 0.  If that tail does not arrive -- an old MRA, a
	// blank save file landing on top of it -- the game boots against an
	// all-zero part, and an all-zero block is NOT the "unprogrammed" case the
	// ROM bails out on: Atari's EEPROM records are Hamming-protected, an
	// ERASED block is UNCORRECTABLE (so the boot gives up after a couple of
	// blocks and logs the small legitimate count) while an ALL-ZERO block is
	// CORRECTABLE (so the boot believes the garbage, walks every block, and
	// logs a large one).  On this game the self test's Error Count reads 16 on
	// an erased part and 64 on a zeroed one -- and 64 is below the ROM's 75
	// threshold, so a zeroed Xybots part shows a wrong count with no
	// "EEPROM ERROR" banner to flag it.
	//
	// So the erased state is established HERE, by the part itself, and does not
	// depend on the loader, the MRA or the synthesis tool's RAM initialisation.
	//
	// Every loader byte reaches this module while `init_reset` is HIGH: at
	// `xybots_main_bus` that input covers the whole of the index-0 stream and
	// the whole of an index-2 restore.  That window is therefore exactly one
	// "image load", and the decision taken when it releases is:
	//
	//   an image was loaded and every byte of it was 0x00  -> ERASE
	//        (a `.nvm` the HPS has never actually written; an all-zero X2804A
	//         is not a state this game can leave behind)
	//   no image was loaded and nothing has ever been written -> ERASE
	//        (the MRA's 0x200-byte erased tail did not arrive)
	//   anything else -> leave the array alone
	//
	// `programmed` is the "something real has been written here" flag; it is
	// deliberately ACTIVE HIGH and RESETLESS so that Quartus's power-up value
	// for such a register -- 0 -- is already the correct one.  It must NOT be
	// cleared by `init_reset`, which also pulses on every OSD reset: clearing it
	// there would erase a restored image or a freshly programmed option.
	//
	// One erase pass is 512 clk_sys = 8.9 us.  The 68000 is held far longer:
	// the 3A LS90 watchdog parks at 9 over power-on and only rolls 9 -> 0 on
	// the first /VBLANK edge after the release -- SYNGEN restarts at
	// (v, h) = (0, 0), so that edge is 240 lines away, 240 * 456 * 8 =
	// 875 520 clk_sys (15.3 ms).  A loader byte in the same cycle wins and
