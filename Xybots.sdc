# ============================================================================
#  Xybots core timing constraints.
#
#  There is exactly ONE fabric clock in the game half of this design:
#
#     clk_sys = 57.272727 MHz  (emu|pll outclk_0 = PLL 50 MHz x 63 / 5 / 11)
#             = 4 x 14.318181 MHz, the SP-313 sheet-4 master crystal.
#             Period 17.461 ns.
#
#  Everything below it advances on synchronous, integer clock ENABLES generated
#  in rtl/xybots_core.sv from one free-running /32 counter:
#
#     ce_14m  = clk_sys / 4   = 14.318181 MHz  (SYNGEN master, sheet 4)
#     ce_7m   = clk_sys / 8   =  7.159091 MHz  (VIDCLK pixel AND the 68000)
#     ce_ym   = clk_sys / 16  =  3.579545 MHz  (JSA I crystal, = video xtal / 4)
#     ce_6502 = clk_sys / 32  =  1.789772 MHz  (JSA I 6502)
#
#  Each slower enable is a strict subset of every faster one (they are decodes of
#  the same counter), so no fractional/asynchronous enable exists anywhere and
#  there is no CDC inside the game logic.  The only genuine crossing between the
#  two PCBs is the SCOM mailbox, which is modelled with an explicit handshake in
#  rtl/sound/xybots_sound_comm.sv, not with a second clock.
#
#  outclk_1 is the same 57.272727 MHz, phase-shifted, driving the SDRAM_CLK pin.
#
#  ---- the rule the multicycle exceptions below obey --------------------------
#  Without them the analyser holds the big CE-gated cores (the T65, parts of
#  jt51) to the full 17.46 ns period, which is FALSE for registers
#  that provably share one clock enable.  Only INTRA-block reg->reg paths are
#  relaxed, and only inside a hierarchy where every sequential process takes the
#  same Enable.  A CE-gated block's OUTPUTS to full-rate logic stay
#  single-cycle: a full-rate sampler may legitimately latch a held CPU output on
#  any clk_sys edge.  Nothing that runs at the full rate — the SDRAM controller,
#  the graphics arbiter, the motion-object engine, the video pipeline, the bus
#  decode — gets an exception of any kind.
#
#  The main CPU is fx68k, which is NOT one of those blocks — it carries two
#  genuinely full-rate registers (its two microcode ROM output flops) and so
#  gets only the four narrow, author-supplied microcode-address exceptions and
#  nothing else.  See the fx68k section below.
# ============================================================================

# ============================================================================
#  MAIN CPU.  fx68k is the core's only 68000.  The exception block is still
#  guarded by a presence test on its own registers and says in the log which way
#  it went, so a constraint that stops matching because a register got renamed
#  shows up as "not in this build" in the STA log instead of disappearing in
#  silence.
# ============================================================================

# ---- fx68k: the microcode address paths ------------------------------------
# These are Jorge Cwik's OWN constraints, quoted from
# rtl/lib/fx68k/fx68k.txt "Timing analysis" ("Microcode access is one of
# the slowest paths on the core.  But the microcode output is not needed
# immediately"), with only the hierarchy completed for this project's instance
# — which that file says is the part that must be modified.  They are `-start`
# in the original; for a single clock `-start` and `-end` are the same
# relationship, so the form is left as the author wrote it.
#
# WHY THEY ARE TRUE HERE, checked in the source rather than taken on trust:
#   * `Ir` is written only under `enT1`            (fx68k.sv:318-323)
#   * `microAddr` and `nanoAddr` only under `enT1` (fx68k.sv:269-272)
#     — their other leg is the `Clks.pwrUp` cold-reset load (fx68k.sv:265-268),
#       which is not in this `-from` collection.
#   * `enT1 = enPhi1 & (tState == T4) & ~wClk`     (fx68k.sv:178)
#     and one pass of the T-state machine (T1->T2->T3->T4->T1, fx68k.sv:184-197)
#     alternates enPhi1/enPhi2, which xybots_cpu.sv places 4 clk_sys apart
#     inside a clk_sys/8 CPU clock.  So successive `enT1` pulses are **16
#     clk_sys** apart (one 68000 micro-cycle = 2 clock periods), and longer
#     whenever the sequencer inserts T0 waits.
# The launch and the capture are the same enable, 16 clk_sys apart, and the
# exception claims **2**.  That is not a relaxation that has to be believed on
# the author's word; it is a factor of eight inside what the structure proves.
# The combinational cloud it covers is rtl/lib/fx68k/uaddrPla.sv, the opcode PLA.

# ---- fx68k gets NO intra-block "it is all ce_7m anyway" exception -----------
# The T65 block below relaxes a whole vendored core because every retained
# update in it is qualified by one enable.  fx68k does NOT qualify: read
# fx68k.sv:2471-2490,
#
#     module uRom(   input clk, ... );  always_ff @(posedge clk) microOutput <= uRam[ microAddr];
#     module nanoRom(input clk, ... );  always_ff @(posedge clk) nanoOutput <= nRam[ nanoAddr];
#
# — the micro-ROM and nano-ROM output registers take **no clock enable at all**
# and are re-clocked on every one of the 57.272727 MHz edges (the author says
# why in the comment above them: it is what makes the two ROMs infer as block
# RAM).  So the claim "every fx68k register is enable-gated by enPhi1/enPhi2"
# is FALSE, a blanket -from/-to over `*u_fx68k|*` would relax two genuinely
# full-rate M10K read paths, and none is applied.  Every fx68k path other than
# the four above is analysed at the full 17.461 ns period.
# (The `-from` collections above are safe under exactly this reading: they name
# `Ir` only, and `Ir` is enable-gated.  The ROM outputs are neither a source nor
# a destination of any exception in this file.)

# ---- JSA I 6502 only --------------------------------------------------------
# Every sequential process in T65.vhd is gated by the same Enable input, which
# rtl/sound/xybots_jsa.sv drives from ce_6502 = clk_sys/32.  Eight cycles is
# deliberately conservative against the real 32-clock interval, and it keeps the
# exception away from anything that might be re-timed into it.  The collection
# is the T65 core inside the wrapper only — the wrapper's own flat-port glue,
# the mailbox, the mixer and the LPF are ordinary full-rate paths.

# ---- jt51 LFO / channel registers into the phase generator ------------------
# jt51 drives the LFO PM value, the channel frequency/modulation registers and
# the operator register file from cen_p1, which xybots_jsa wires to ce_6502; the
# phase generator's keycode_II destination is clocked by the same enable.  At
# 57.27 MHz successive cen_p1 pulses are 32 fabric clocks apart, so these data
# cannot be launched and captured on adjacent clk_sys edges.  The exception is
# kept on the exact source blocks and the exact destination rather than
# relaxing all of jt51: its timer flags and wrapper state do NOT uniformly share
# this enable.  Two clocks is deliberately conservative, with the standard N-1
# hold adjustment.

# ============================================================================
#  SDRAM external I/O timing (MT48LC16M16 class, CL2, 57.272727 MHz controller).
#
#  SDRAM_CLK is PLL outclk_1 (the SECOND output counter, general[1]) wired
#  straight to the pin in Arcade-Xybots.sv -- a clean phase-controlled clock, so
#  these delays can actually close.  Datasheet values, same chip class as the
#  sibling cores.  If Quartus reports the -source PLL node cannot be found, open
#  Timing Analyzer -> Report Clocks and substitute the actual outclk_1
#  ...general[1]...divclk path; if it does not apply, the SDRAM I/O simply falls
#  back to unconstrained rather than failing the build.
#
#  DO NOT TUNE THE READ-CAPTURE PHASE FROM THIS REPORT.  The Setup Summary is
#  keyed by the CAPTURE clock, so the SDRAM_CLK row is the command/write LAUNCH
#  and the DQ return is buried in the clk_sys row with ordinary core logic --
#  neither isolates the capture, and the spread across refits is the same size
#  as the effect.  The phase rtl/pll/pll_0002.v carries (+13095 ps = tap 66 =
#  270 deg) was found by an eight-point sweep on real hardware, which put the
#  working window at 225-315 deg; STA predicted the wrong answer every time it
#  was consulted.  Re-sweep on a board, not from this report.
